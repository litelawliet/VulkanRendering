# VulkanRendering
This project is my first try at Vulkan by following the official Vulkan tutorial on https://vulkan-tutorial.com/.

The goal of this project is to end up having a simple but effective structure for rendering any 3D models in Vulkan using assimp ad models loader library.

Afterwards this small project is going to be used as a base for my end of study project which involved in making a complete game engine with GUI from scratch, using my personnal math library and make a game out of it.
